Description: Plots the complete pooling, no pooling, and partially pooled estimates for a mixed effects model.
    Scholars have defined mixed effects models as a compromise between complete pooling estimates (i.e., those 
    from a linear model ignoring a grouping factor), no pooling estimates (i.e., a linear model for which each
    level of the grouping factor is dummy-coded), and partially pooled estimates (i.e., those from mixed effects 
    models, for which group-specific estimates are shrunken to (or gather strength from) the overall estimates 
    (Gelman & Hill, 2007).
